# CapsNet
A TensorFlow implementation of Hinton's "Dynamic Routing Between Capsules" paper, using CIFAR-10 dataset

To run, first download CIFAR-10 dataset from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
extract cifar-10-batches-py folder and put it in the same dir as capsnet_cifar.py (or change dataset path in the code). 

On a single 1080Ti, training with default parameters takes 15 min per epoch.

TODO: implement "none of the above" class.
